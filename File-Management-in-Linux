To listout the files and folders: ls  (ls means list)
some folders are in blue, green colour. Note: blue colour indicates folder.
To go into the particular folder or directory: cd <folder or directory name> (cd means change directory).
after going into that folder, if you want to list out the files and foldres in that dirctory, again we can us "ls" command.
To come back out of the folder, use cd .. cd stands for "change directory".   .. means the parent directory of your current location. 
To know which directory you are working in : pwd (present working directory).
How to create directory or folder in the particular directory: mkdir <directory-name> (mk means make)
To delete the created directory: rmdir <directory-name>
To create file in particular directory or folder: touch <file-name> (file displayed as white colour).
To copy a folder into a new folder: cp -r <source-folder> <destination-folder>
To delete the file: rm <file-name>
To copy the file into another file: cp <old file name> <new file-name>  This will create the new file, and copy the contents of old file into new file.
To rename the file: mv <old file name> <new file-name> (Moves or renames a file or directory.)

To Write contents into the file: we need to install "vim" editor: command is <apt install vim>  if you are not the root user: sudo apt install vim
you created one file: touch span, to enter into the file: vim <file-name>  ex: vim span
There are 3 modes in VI editor:
1.Normal Mode (Default): used for navigation and command execution.
2.Insert Mode: Used for text editing, press i to enter, esc to exit.
3.Command Mode: Used for saving, quitting and searching (press : in normal mode).
After going into the file by executing the "vim span" command, to write the content or text into the file, press i and starting writing into that file.
Now to save the file, press "esc", now you are in Command mode, and now to save & quit th file, give ":wq!"  w is for save the file and q is to quit the file.
Now to view the contents in your file: execute "cat <file-name>

Practice:
root@DESKTOP-8AJF2HB:/tmp# cat span
I love linux while learning.

File management in Linux

ls – Lists files and directories in the current location.
cd /path/to/directory – Changes the working directory.
pwd – Prints the current working directory.
mkdir new_folder – Creates a new directory.
rmdir empty_folder – Removes an empty directory.
rm file.txt – Deletes a file.
rm -r folder – Deletes a folder and its contents.
cp file1.txt file2.txt – Copies a file.
cp -r dir1 dir2 – Copies a directory recursively.
mv old_name new_name – Moves or renames a file or directory.



File Viewing and Editing

cat file.txt – Displays file content.
tac file.txt – Displays file content in reverse order.
less file.txt – Opens a file for viewing with scrolling support.
more file.txt – Similar to less, but only moves forward.
head -n 10 file.txt – Displays the first 10 lines of a file.
tail -n 10 file.txt – Displays the last 10 lines of a file.
nano file.txt – Opens a simple text editor.
vi file.txt – Opens a powerful text editor.
echo 'Hello' > file.txt – Writes text to a file, overwriting existing content.
echo 'Hello' >> file.txt – Appends text to a file without overwriting.
